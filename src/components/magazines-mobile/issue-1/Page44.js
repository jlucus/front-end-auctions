          <p>As the confluence of the coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent effects lead to a global population living increasingly virtual lives, so is the metaverse coming to fruition — a live, digital universe where real people can live virtual lives and participate in a virtual economy with far-ranging societal effects.</p>
          <p>This phenomenon has led to an increased interest in the computer-generated extensions of our identities in the virtual worlds we are slowly but surely encroaching, as the lines between the physical and the digital start to blur.</p>
          <p>And we've been cultivating digital identities for quite some time now. Think of all the countless hours you've spent agonizing about what to bless others' social media feeds with. Think of all the terms and conditions (as well as social media mores and folkways) you juggle with to play by the rules so your digital identity can exist on a particular platform.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>As billions of individuals are forced home, and restrictions on movement are implemented, multitudes are creating digital identities in the form of avatars that traverse, inhabit, and live out their days in the landscapes of the emerging metaverse — console, platform, or architecture notwithstanding. </p>
          <p>While graphics have come a long way from the days of the Atari, one of the more challenging details even the best video game developers struggle with is the sheer complexity of trying to recreate a realistic digital avatar — and this process can take a lot of time and resources to create.</p>
          <p>Developing realistic virtual representations of our digital humans also requires the immense know-how that only the top studios possess.</p>
          <p>At least until Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite and the Unreal Engine, created the MetaHuman Creator: a cloud-streamed app that can build lifelike virtual representations of humans for video games and movies in mere minutes — at an unprecedented level of fidelity, accessibility, and scalability. It's made the onboarding process into the 3D content environments ten times easier than it would have.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Even as the app is in early access, the hype is building up, and for a good reason. Epic streamlined many of the tedious, time-consuming tasks related to creating computer-generated content at an amazing level of granularity. From how far your digital avatar's lip protrudes, to the number of stray beard hairs your digital appearance possesses, the MetaHuman Creator sets the bar as far as creating believable digital humans is concerned. These virtual beings — the metahumans — can then be animated via the Unreal Engine that can be used in 3D environments across video games and films. </p>
          <p>The democratization of online player presence has arrived, and it's sweet AF. Creating avatars hasn't been this easy, and the implications are massive. Full-fledged, lifelike, and tailormade avatars that can fluently navigate in between metaverses are now one step closer to reality. It's another giant step for metahumankind. </p>
          <p>This development is yet another representation of the emerging metaverse, the parallel universe that exists within the material world we live in, one unbound by the constraints of the physical realm — and one we can switch on and off to by logging on to a website or by turning on a piece of hardware.</p>
          <p>We're moving fast towards it, and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic only highlighted the paradigm shift we're currently experiencing. Think about it — aren't you surprised at how many real-life tasks you've started to do in front of a screen since lockdowns and social distancing became the norm? Everything from ordering food, paying bills, playing, to socializing, it's astounding at how much we've adapted a year into the pandemic.</p>
