          <h1>Raw Thoughts. </h1>
          <h2>Hvdson</h2>
          <p>Hey! I’m *redacted* the systems/persona administrator speaking on behalf of the Hvdson project - a decentralized headless brand (launch date tbd) 🤖❤️🎵. </p>
          <p>Before i was a regular lame ass artist that was trying to follow the traditional music industry route, but that was lame af like hedge funds, so i decided to pivot to something that wasn’t so boomer and here we are with web3.</p>
          <p>as for my music style, i’ve been all over the place - picked up a bunch of instruments as a kid but didn’t have anyone to play with so i thought i’d just learn enough to record for a band, found electronic music and realized i could do all that in the computer, {'<'}stuff about the process that no one cares about cause they only want the result and event{'>'} COVID happened - quit music for a bit and went to work as a software engineer, crypto go up, and now here somehow 🚀</p>
          <p>I first found out about Bitcoin back 2013, mined maybe about ~10 on my shitty laptop on the time and forgot about it for a while (the laptop was never recoverable). </p>
          <p>Then to 2017 a friend of mine mentioned that he was in this thing called Ethereum and i looked into it and aped in cause it sounded cool. </p>
          <p>Price went up, market crashed but held the belief that this could change the world, so i just hodled since i expected 0 or moon on it. Fast forward to the future, thanks to my past self for 💎🙌 it went up and caught my attention again and now i’m in it for the long run. Went searching for a community that was forward and long-term thinking and found $FWB (friends with benefits) and through that community i found songcamp through another member matthew chaim - the one that started the idea of songcamp :)</p>
          <p>Can you tell us more about your release with songcamp and the genesis batch collaboration? </p>
          <p>the camp itself and the tooling setup is the first of its kind from what i know - we’re sitting on the bleeding edge of protocols and tooling with a fee-less ‘music lego’ structure, which will allow all the parties to get paid in a trust-less way, granted that the fee structure was set up at the beginning. to me that’s amazing since having to wait to get paid for a service after invoicing someone is dumb.</p>
          <h3>FIRST DROP. AUDIO NFTS.</h3>
          <p>it’s cool that it’s the first drop of it’s kind, but the real work has just begun. in this new internet that we’re building, no one knows wtf they’re doing - we’re all throwing paint at the wall and duct-taping stuff to get it working. but that being said, it’s so exciting for every artist in the space - for the first time we can get paid directly for our art. no middlemen, no bs, no having to compromise. we’re all building stuff together and i think that’s beautiful.</p>
          <p>imo NFTs right now are just a cash grab and are a bubble - i’m hyped at the possibility of making money off of this directly. people are getting discouraged because they’re not making $69 million on their NFT that they posted. </p>
          <p>but to me i see this bubble as a necessary step to weed out the noise in the short run. the attention economy is dwindling and celebrities of a singular nature will be a thing of the past. </p>
          <p>they’re trying to grab as much cash as they can after their time is up. celebrities die. headless brands are forever. as for right now i am doing the same thing i have before since the tools are the same.</p>
          <p>everything is so low fidelity right now and the best we can do is the equivalent of Ed Catmull trying to make a 2021 pixar film in the 1970s - we’re so early. all we have is jpgs and low effort octane renders. </p>
          <p>i’m excited to see what the future holds when technology advances and the tools develop to the state of where we are now in web2. </p>
          <p>Here’s a project i released back right as covid hit called “In Security”</p>

          <h1>QUICK CHAT WITH MATT.</h1>
          <p>audio nfts first swallowed matthew chaims, founder of songcamp, back in the fall of 2020. It was a ‘light on’ moment where he realised just how much web3 and nfts can empower artists; especially those that aren’t cookie cutter and don’t fit as well into the current traditional music industry, whether that be because of the way that they work or the type of music that they make.</p>
          <p>matt, through songcamp, ran the very first web3 music art collaboration with 9 different artists; it was a virtual song camp. using web3 tools to experiment and start Building a community that can act as an extremely valuable and accessible place for musicians to be able to fall down the same rabbit hole. because now, there just isn’t enough onboarding, supportive hand holding. songcamp is building frameworks to bring in more musicians and artists as a whole who don’t know what is going on; they just read these headlines about beeple and $69 million nft auctions, but they just don’t know what that even means. because, how can they be expected to?</p>
          <p>matt knows that web3 and nfts will proliferate and eat their way into the entire music industry, bringing completely new avenues of value to artists. and, musicians really need that. even as an artist himself, matt has millions of streams on some top streaming platforms like spotify and still sees no tangible value from it. it’s opaque, it takes forever and you are just getting fractions of a penny. for so long this has felt like the only way. but now, it’s obvious that it’s not. there are other ways and we are just beginning to experiment with radical optimism of opportunity that these other ways support.</p>
