        <p>Andrea is a multidisciplinary designer and innovator originally from Colombia. Andrea’s background is in apparel and textile design but her work has expanded to include the areas of footwear design and digital experiences. Now Andrea leads from a design perspective projects across those different competencies at Adidas’s innovation team - Future. </p>
        <p>Andrea joined Adidas back in 2014 and since has been helping build the latest innovations for the brand.

Andrea is passionate to build the next generation of functional NFT experiences for the Metaverse as well as to build bridges to the physical world in more sustainable ways. </p>
