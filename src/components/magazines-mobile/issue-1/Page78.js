              Just as the world is grasping the idea of digital art and NFTs, a real estate boom is breaking out. 
              And it's not happening in your backyard: it's happening in the virtual realms of the metaverse.

            In Hong Kong, the most expensive piece of real estate housing has been sitting on the market for three years, and you could own it for a cool $450 million. 
            It's a property located at the Peak, the most prestigious neighborhood in the most expensive real estate market in the world, 
            a colonial estate covering over 7,700 square meters, offering breathtaking views of the region, 
            secluded in an evergreen paradise of Victoria Peak with nary a neighbor in sight. 
            A buyer paid over $178 million for a mansion in the same affluent neighborhood, representing the most lucrative residential sale in the entire continent.
            <br /><br />

            $450 million isn't chump change. In fact, it's downright obscene in a world where 36% of the population live under less than $1 a day. 
            Local whispers talk about how outrageous the going prices for real estate in the area go, if not downright absurd. 
            More astounding is the fact that these homes and apartments that they're mostly empty. 
            What price is too much for a piece of real estate that's been depreciating since 1991?
            <br /><br />

            True enough, we as a species are terrible judges of an asset's value, particularly when they are pegged at a higher value than their actual utility really is. 
            It's the same reason why we find prices of real estate at the Peak, or a particular piece of art goes for eye-watering sums of money.
            <br /><br />

            But the truth is, asset values are determined by whatever society's collective agreement dictates it to be. It has nothing at all to do with utility.
            <br /><br />

            Art valuation works the same — its value is nothing more than what we agree on. It doesn't matter what materials went to its production or its utility. 
            That's why most of us mere mortals cannot process their true worth. If you think otherwise, then I've got some tulip bulbs for you to buy.
