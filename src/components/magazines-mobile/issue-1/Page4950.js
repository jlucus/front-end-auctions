        A few projects in the NFT field I am excited about:
        <br />
        <br />I believe the NFT fractionalisation field is super interesting. This consists
        basically of fractionalising an NFT into ECR-20 shares that can be freely traded, and with
        certain rules for when a buy-out can happen. A buy-out means someone pays full price to buy
        the underlying NFT (eg. through an auction), and when this happens the owners of the ERC-20
        shares receive the revenues from the sale, proportionally to their share of the ERC-20
        supply.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are three projects in this field that I have been following closely: Nftfy (
        <br />
        @nftfyofficial
        <br /> on twitter), Fractional (
        <br />
        @fractional_art
        <br />) and Niftex (
        <br />
        @NIFTEX
        <br />
        ).
        <br />
        On the Gaming + NFTs field, a part from the more high profile upcoming projects like
        Illuvium (
        <br />
        @illuviumio
        <br />
        ), one smaller project that I find very promising is Mist (
        <br />
        @MistNft
        <br />
        ), which is probably the first open world action RPG game (think Diablo or Runescape)
        centered around NFTs.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the more pure Metaverse projects, I am really interested in http://Bit.Country (
        <br />
        @BitDotCountry
        <br />
        ), which I believe will be a major Metaverse project running on Polkadot with their own
        Parachain.
        <br />
        <br />
        And of course, my personal favorite is Digitalax :) building the infrastructure for
        integrating digital fashion NFTs into non block-chain native games, VR and other 3D
        applications."
