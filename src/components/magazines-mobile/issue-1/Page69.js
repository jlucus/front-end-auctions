        <h1>Is the metaverse already broken?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The emergence of the coronavirus pandemic over the last year led to an unprecedented number of individuals displaced from the "real" world they once knew — towards hitherto unexperienced entirely new virtual worlds and online gaming environments.</p>
          <p>This massive influx of individuals towards the metaverse — or the confluence of our physical and digital identities brought about by the internet, extended reality, and blockchain technology — has created the conditions for a brewing social upheaval that's materializing right before our very eyes.</p>
          <p>Boomers would have laughed off the concept of playing video games to make a person's life better until recently. But, see, there's always been this negative perception that video games are nothing more than just a waste of time, apart from being an clear and present danger to those who play them the most.</p>
          <p>But that perception is dropping faster than a bad habit.</p>
          <p>Perhaps prolific game designer, author, and futurist Jane McGonigal was on to something when she wrote about how this massive movement of human action, engagement, communication, relationships, and identities in the virtual worlds of gaming can mean something bigger than just narcissistic escapism.</p>
          <p>According to McGonigal, reality doesn't motivate us nearly enough as playing our favorite video games does. And if we can leverage the power of games to unplug from reality, why can't we harness their power to take that same motivation into the "real world"? It seems to be more important than ever to do so, considering the fact that 21st century pandemic living has given birth to the 21st century schizoid man.</p>
          <p>Reality sucks. So does the "new normal."</p>
          <p>Regardless of where you stand about video gaming as a hobby (and the moral pissing contest that usually goes along with it), one thing remains for sure: video games, which are essentially metaverses that humans digitally explore, act, and live in, are fulfilling genuine human needs that the real world cannot — or can no longer — satisfy. </p>
