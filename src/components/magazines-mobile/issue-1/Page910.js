          Each portion of this digital piece of real estate is an NFT. These assets are non-fungible; hence they cannot be duplicated. Furthermore, the unique digital identifiers on NFTs serve as immutable proof of ownership of the underlying digital asset — in this case, digital real estate. In essence, digital real estate is another iteration of NFTs like Beeple's record-breaking artwork that possess inherent transferability, and like artwork, can be bought from primary and secondary sales. Games allow players to purchase digital ownership rights — virtual title deeds, as it were — in the form of an NFT. Digital real estate is unbound by building codes, restrictions, and the tricky nature of real estate ownership and dealing with government agencies. And thanks to the power of the blockchain's decentralized ledger, the integrity of these assets is secured.

          <span>The Metaverse Emerges</span>
          <br />
          As the metaverse starts taking shape, virtual worlds are no longer just the realm of the younger set, considering entirely new metaverses are being created for adults for them to inhabit. Furthermore, these virtual worlds are built on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that the transactions taking place in those worlds use cryptocurrency.
          <br /><br />
          Existing virtual worlds, including Decentraland, The Sandbox, Cryptovoxels, and Somnium Space are experiencing record high purchases in virtual assets like land, building, art, and others. have seen new highs on prices of land, images, and others — and the virtual economy that supports them is thriving. That hasn't gone unnoticed by industry leaders looking to expand into the metaverse.
          <br /><br />
          Decentraland, one of the first metaverses that came into being, has cleared over $55 million in sales as of the end of April 2021, and its partnerships are heating up. Gaming giant Atari recently signed a two-year lease for prime parcels in Decentraland, where they will soon build the first crypto casino of the metaverse. At a time where physical casino and sports betting establishments have faced widespread closures due to the coronavirus pandemic, players will be able to walk into a virtual casino with their avatar, socialize, and play their favorite games. It's the next logical evolution for live dealer casinos, and it's going to launch this May.
          <br /><br />
          <span>Limitless Marketing Potential</span>
          <br />
          As the metaverse grows, so does its user base. And there lies massive, unbound advertising potential for companies to promote their products and services in an immersive, truly unique customer experience. High-traffic areas in the metaverse will also become the digital equivalents of Shibuya Crossing or Times Square.

        <p>
          Once droves of new users start inhabiting the metaverse in numbers that are more than just a drop in the bucket, marketing physical products to people's individual avatars in the virtual realms becomes a breeze.
          <br /><br />
          Big companies opening virtual stores in virtual worlds is a natural progression, and they are already starting to do so.
          <br /><br />
          We're at the conflux of two trends — the fact that people have been forced to stay home and live virtual lives in front of a computer screen on the internet for over a year, as well as a new audience of individuals who grew up playing the Sims, Roblox, or Minecraft. Companies taking advantage of this emergent metaverse are advertising right where they live. 
          <br /><br />
          There will come a day of reckoning when every brand understands that they need their piece of land in the metaverse that offers this unbridled potential — much in the same way they need a Facebook page or a website.
          <br /><br />
          Speculators betting on scarcity can be understood as far as capital appreciation is concerned. A 10x is a 10x in any market, no matter how or where you get it—end of.
          <br /><br />
          But the designers, creators, and players who are technically proficient enough to build on the platform have even greater opportunities to monetize. Think of the casinos, museums, art galleries, pubs, and clubs they can build and charge entrance or rent out for advertising. The beauty of the metaverse is that their developers look at them as a platform — a blank canvas, as it were — to build creative structures and assets on them and attract the throngs of new potential users at an unprecedented time where humans need more connection than ever.
          <br /><br />
          Regardless, the virtual real estate industry is already taking giant steps. Skyrocketing NFT and digital real estate prices are potentially just a fraction of what they might be worth in the near future once adoption takes hold. If a digital piece of artwork can be worth $69 million, who's to say virtual real estate can't be worth the same — if not even more?
