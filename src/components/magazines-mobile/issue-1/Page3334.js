          <p>Meanwhile, NONHUMAN is a digital fashion agency founded by Dylan Tull, which focuses on creating immersive experiences with artists seeking to push the boundaries on what is and what should never be in digital fashion, leveraging the vast power of XR to create 3D pieces that redefine what we can and can't put on our digital identities in the metaverse.</p>
          <p>Conclusion <br />
          As Kent Bye, one of the foremost voices in extended reality put it, fashion in virtual worlds has always been huge, and it will only get bigger. And we're seeing that coming to fruition as extended reality develops at a frighteningly accelerated pace. </p>
          <p>After all, the idea of an extended reality — the metaverse, as it were — is inseparable from fashion. Fashion represents our collective aspirations, meant to create an insatiable longing for the unattainable versus the mundane world we live in. Fashion, at its very core, is a fundamental expression of our identities. It's so human. And as we take our identities towards the metaverse, they become digitized, as social media muddles what we construe as tangible and intangible realities, as extended realities increasingly become the norm rather than the exception.</p>
          <p>As we constantly blur the line between the physical and virtual world, there is no shortage of actors standing at the forefront of digital fashion, extended reality, and the metaverse. We've barely scratched the surface of what is possible between fashion in the physical realm and the metaverse — and we can’t wait for what the future holds. Fashion in the metaverse? Bring it.</p>
