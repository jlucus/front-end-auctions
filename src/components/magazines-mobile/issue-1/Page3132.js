        <p>NFTs benefiting brands NFTs have also become part and parcel of the developing metaverse, and they've definitely hit their stride in terms of popularity in recent months, with artists and celebrities getting in on the buzz as digital items going for tens of millions of dollars at auctions. </p>
        <p>Supermodel Karlie Kloss joined forces with Adidas and esteemed digital fashion house The Fabricant to create an entirely digital iteration of the Wind.RDY jacket from the adidas x Karlie Kloss line. Digital artists were given the opportunity to create their own interpretations of the best-selling jacket, with 20 of them going for auction, whose proceeds were shared by the designers and Kode with Klossy, the supermodel's nonprofit.</p>
        <p>Luxury watchmaker Jacob & Co. partnered with NFT platform ArtGrails to sell the first-ever digital NFT watch, which went for an eye-watering $100,000 from an initial bid price of $5,000. The watch comes with all the necessary regalia, such as a certificate of ownership and a case containing a hard drive with a digital rendering of the luxury watch.</p>
        <p>While much of the hype is centered on fashion brands taking advantage of the potentially lucrative marketing opportunities NFTs pose, the underlying technology — the ability to authenticate, verify, and track — is here to stay. There is some serious steak beyond all the sizzle we've been seeing.</p>
        <p>Innovation the new norm As the fashion industry continues to pivot towards full-on digitalization, innovation has become the new norm. Interoperability is a critical facet of digital fashion, in fashion and in gaming, which are both industries traditionally long been siloed and walled off by the big boys. Nowhere is this more evident than Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney's crusade against tech giants Apple and Google, and the hullabaloo that led to Nike putting the kibosh on the infamous collaboration between Lil Nas X and MSCHF that led to the creation of Satan Shoes (and their more angelic counterpart, Jesus Shoes.) Imagine exerting effort to cancel a fucking shoe</p>
        <p>DIGITALAX is pioneering the first-ever digital fashion NFT platform and interoperable infrastructure across live content environments, seeking to break the silos that exist in fashion and in gaming. Artists and creators can create every single element of a particular garment (such as raw materials, patterns, and textures) as NFTs, which can then be sourced from the DIGITALAX platform to on-chain libraries across virtual platforms with full interoperability. Their recent collaboration with Polygon (formerly Matic) is yet another critical development in the adoption of digital fashion by enabling rapid scaling, reduce barriers and make participation accessible for everyone, and minimal gas costs.</p>
