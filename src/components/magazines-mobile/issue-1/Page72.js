          <p>Hi! I am Arez, I am 22 year old artist and designer from Russia.</p>
          <p>I started making my first art in high school when I was drawing skins and weapon finishes for a CS:GO workshop. </p>
          <p>Over time as my interests expanded I started learning CS:GO modding, and eventually went into a design school, where I acquired most of my skills in graphic design, sketching, 3d modeling, animation and rendering. </p>
          <p>I now use this skillset to work on Parabellum, a project of my own, a game based on CS:GO. A Few years ago I became interested in abstract fine arts and paintings. This year I finished Union of Russian Abstractionists school and received a Kandinsky Medal.</p>
          <p>I like combining different skills in one artwork, rather than sticking to just one medium. I am currently working on my "X T R O P Y" art project, which is focused on the power of red light and color. My rule is that if it exists, you can make art with it."</p>
