          <p>The outcome will determine whether Fortnite will ever make a comeback to iOS devices, whether Epic can continue to access the Unreal Engine on iOS platforms, and lastly, whether third-party app stores can launch on iOS devices or otherwise. If Epic can prove Apple's monopoly, any game publisher can create their app store on iOS devices, opening the door for games to be playable on iOS.</p>

          <p>The heat is on as industry secrets are about to be dragged out in the public arena — something Apple keeps under close lock and key. The trial is shaping up to be an opportunity to get a rare look at Apple’s walled garden and the magic that happens behind it. The main point of contention is the inherent 70%-30% revenue scheme on the App Store, with Apple obviously taking the lion’s share of the profits. Epic is framing that arrangement as unfair and one-sided, while Apple has been painting the latter as a disingenuous, avaricious partner — as the tech giant faces its biggest legal threat in recent memory. </p>
          <p>It’s going to be a tooth and nail fight that may change the way the gaming industry — and in the bigger picture — how the metaverse evolves, and we should be paying more attention to this skirmish because of the far-ranging consequences it poses for the fledgling layer of reality that’s emerging right beneath our collective noses.</p>
          <p>We can all chalk it up to the growing pains of the metaverse — Sweeney's stand against the walled gardens exemplified by the fight against Apple is just what we need to plot out the future of the metaverse and progress to the next stage of the paradigm shift. Are we going to see a dramatic rearranging of the metaverse’s cosmology? Time will tell. Sooner or later.</p>
