          <p>And, as the internet moves towards an open, trustless, and permissionless model — a prelude to the eventual decentralization of the internet as we know it, one driven by blockchain protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum — we see the next logical step towards the evolution of the metaverse. </p>
          <p>An internet that's not bound by the whims and caprices of large, centralized corporations and platform owners like Facebook, Apple, or Google, which store massive amounts of information about you and me that they use to sell us things and influence us for the benefit of their almighty advertisers. All with no seeming consequences for their negligence, misconduct, or wrongdoing. </p>
          <p>That's not to mention the ever-growing file they build on each of us with every piece of personal information we willingly surrender to them in favor of the value of the services that they provide — subjecting ourselves to draconian terms and conditions that, with one wrong move, can lead to the social media equivalent of damnatio memoriae.</p>
          <p>We've seen how Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube can Thanos-snap even the most popular of accounts for a single faux pas (or by coordinated mass reporting), whether substantiated or otherwise — taking every photo, video, story, post, or piece of content along with them. Every single hour spent crafting content. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>But imagine if there was a way to keep every single piece of content you've created regardless of whatever platform you have it on and be able to move it fluently from one 3D environment to another without any technical restraints? What if there was a way to go beyond the walled gardens that prevent connectivity between different content that Big Tech has so skillfully built to lock users into their dystopian ecosystems?</p>
          <p>Pretty soon, the days of Facebook, Apple, and Google owning every single piece of your digital life will be no longer a thing. Rather, you own your online presence — and everything that goes with it. The emergence of Web3 will change the way we think about the ownership of our digital lives. And NFTs are the key to this new standard of ownership. </p>
          <p>NFTs prove this immutable ownership over your digital assets, including your avatar. And while we can all debate endlessly on how NFTs might or might not be under a bubble, one thing's for sure: the technology is not going anywhere as the metaverse takes shape along with Web3. And as avatars are literally our digital representations, it makes perfect sense to own them alongside the other digital assets that we own instead of leaving them at the mercy of an absentee landlord.</p>
          <p>Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney has become one of the leading figures for the metaverse, taking the fight against the walled gardens that prevent it from fully blooming. Closed systems are the norm, thus leading to less competition at every point in the value chain. Apart from that, there are no technical interoperability standards, and you can't move from one environment to another. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>The metaverse needs to be an open, live, evolving platform with builders creating worlds of all kinds that are interoperable and interact with each other. A blockchain-based foundation for an open metaverse is the apparent path towards a long-term open framework Sweeney is advocating for — one that's free from any gatekeeping, and every actor has their agency. And NFTs will be the bedrock of that metaverse. The technology is already here, and it's not going away anytime soon.</p>
          <p>Sweeney advocates for a shardless environment enabling virtual content environments to scale to massive sizes without the closed approach that creates broken rather than immersive experiences.</p>
          <p>His advocacy has led him to take Apple head on in response to a series of events that led to Epic Games filing an antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant. TL;DR: Epic implemented its own payment system on iOS to circumvent Apple's charges, which was against App Store rules. In response, Apple took down Epic's apps, including Fortnite.</p>
