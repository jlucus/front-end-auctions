        <div className={styles.textTitle}>ELASTICDAO</div>
        <br />A platform to manage decentralised organisations and make governance fairer. Projects
        will be able to launch their DAOs and governance tokens through the platform where
        ElasticDAO’s solution to governance achieves three main goals; whale proof, free-rider
        proof, and it is very much a “skin in the game” approach where token holders are directly
        incentivised to participate and contribute to the project’s success. It’s a super innovative
        approach that manages to solve some of the biggest issues in project governance, while still
        being a great profitable investment for active governance participants. $EGT tokens are
        directly backed by the projects ETH treasury, allowing anyone to exit by redeeming and
        burning their $EGT in exchange for their share in the $ETH treasury. This not only
        incentivises voters to only vote for expenses that will be beneficial and bring value to the
        project over the long term, since these expenses will be taking $ETH out of the treasury and
        decreasing the amounts backing each $EGT. But, also, in the case of an attempted hostile
        take-over by whales buying a large part of the supply to take control of governance, token
        holders will always be able to redeem/burn their tokens and exit with their share of the
        treasury as a last line of defense.

        <div className={styles.textTitle}>PUSH PROTOCOL</div>
        <br />
        The first ‘Ethereum Push Notification Service’ (EPNS)— a decentralised notification protocol
        that enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications directly from decentralised
        or centralised services in a privacy preserving manner. Today, communication between web3
        providers and consumers often occurs through email, social media, Telegram, etc. This
        defeats the purpose of web3, as it depends on centralised providers and sacrifices user
        privacy, especially for communications specific to the users’ wallets. And to preserve
        decentralisation and privacy, major DeFi platforms don’t even have user logins or
        notifications. So today if a loan is liquidated on Aave or Compound, there is no way to
        notify the wallet owner. Users need to actively monitor their wallets for such events. EPNS
        solves all of this. And, their integration of IPFS means notifications can include not only
        text, but also images, audio and video. Some possible notification types; wallet crypto
        movement tracker, ENS domain expiry, loan liquidation alert, limit order triggered on DEX,
        communication of urgent information to token holders (protocol exploit, token swap
        deadlines, etc).

        <div className={styles.textTitle}>M!XSOM3</div>
        <br />A DeFi strategy aggregator that allows the execution of a collection of DeFi
        strategies (“flows”) by wrapping up multiple transactions into a joint transaction that is
        then executed by a single smart contract. And, it’s built on xDAI for greater sustainability
        in transaction costs and speed— a strategy that would usually involve 3 or 4 gas hungry txs
        on ETH L1, will now involve two simpler bridging txs (to get in and out of the xDAI
        sidechain) and all the remaining complex txs will happen on xDAI. An example of DeFi Flow
        would be: swap ETH for DAI -> deposit DAI into Curve to get yCRV -> deposit yCRV into yearn
        to get yUSD. Doing all this in a single, low-fee wrapped tx will not only save a lot of gas
        fees, but will also make the whole process a lot more user friendly. Imagine showing a
        no-coiner friend that they can go from fiat to USD stablecoins on curve/yearn earning
        15%-20% APYs with a few clicks, and without ever needing to get exposure to more volatile
        crypto assets!? This is how we get the next wave of #DeFi adoption.

      <div className={styles.rightText}>HYPERREAALIYAH</div>
      <div className={styles.rightText1}>
        HYPERREAALIYAH was founded in 2014 through a process that involved the writings of Jean
        Baudrillard, one (1) bitcoin worth of acid in that day’s exchange rate, and a handful of
        people. Since the beginning, HYPERREAALIYAH has existed as a simulation of an artist, born
        again for each new project through the collaborators of said project. Sometimes for clarity
        HYPERREAALIYAH is referred to as a collective, although it has no formal membership but
        becomes realised through projects for which a new team is always formed. Both professional
        artists and non-artists have participated in the production of works of HYPERREAALIYAH.
        <br />
        <br />
        The name HYPERREAALIYAH consists of two parts; (1) hyperreal which translates to “more real
        than real”. This is a category often experienced in a mediated world where the
        representation of a thing becomes more real than the thing itself. For example, a news story
        about a hurricane on the other side of the globe is more real to its reader than the
        hurricane itself; and (2) aaliyah which is a judaic concept meaning a return to the holy
        land. Thus, HYPERREAALIYAH is a more real than real return to the holy lands of, in this
        case, meaning.
        <br />
        <br />
        The premise for HYPERREAALIYAH, the reason for its existence is the argument that as
        hyperreality has become an everyday phenomenon, we are all in diaspora from meaning.
        HYPERREAALIYAH is always looking for a way to return to meaning, but never quite seems to
        get there.
        <br />
        <br />
        Throughout the past years, HYPERREAALIYAH has produced multiple different projects ranging
        from video works to performances and artivistic interventions in public, semi-public and
        private spaces both online and offline. HYPERREAALIYAH's works have been screened, performed
        or featured in Amos Rex, Institute of Contemporary Art London, Kaiku, Oksasenkatu 11,
        POLARIZED! festival, Pixelache, Socialinis Centras Emma, Visio festival and XI20, among
        others. HYPERREAALIYAH has researched and produced works about memes and memetics in
        particular and works critiquing neoliberal ideology and fascistic societal movements in
        general.

      <div className={styles.rightText2}>HYPERREAALIYAH’s First NFT Series</div>
      <div className={styles.rightText3}>
        Since the beginning, HYPERREAALIYAH has considered everything in existence as material to be
        moulded into new forms. This creative process has embodied a commentary on the structure of
        mediated reality as a surface which can be used to create new meaning although it is
        sometimes controlled by copyright. HYPERREAALIYAH’s argument has been that if the meaning of
        a work that uses copyrighted material is new or, say, original, the copyrighted material
        loses its meaning and gains a new one.
        <br />
        <br />
        Their first NFT drop will consist of three 3D pieces, sculptured objects. Each of them has a
        unique form but the surface of the objects will be made of copyrighted material – colours,
        patterns, characters, nothing in the surface will be copyright free but as a new totality it
        will be, according to our argument and also the Fair Use doctrine.
        <br />
        <br />A theme within a theme is the transition from web2 to web3. The rarest piece of the
        three will hold a conversation about the future of the internet as a structure with the
        potential of upholding and proliferating human rights, among other things. The form of this
        conversation is still under construction – it might be embodied in the object itself or be
        located in a point referred to by the object, depending on the final narration.
