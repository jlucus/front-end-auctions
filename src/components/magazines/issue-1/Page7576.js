        Through DIGIFIZZY we are proving out a new publishing model with NFT based decentralised
        subscriptions. All of the content is free to read, and, people can subscribe to NFT bundles
        that bring together a mix of well known and upcoming/undervalued talent across music, art,
        fashion, gaming, other collectibles etc. This is not an auction or a typical drop, but
        unlike where if creators were featured on the cover of a magazine they would get nothing for
        it or sometimes have to pay for placement, here they get a share distributed across the
        contributors to the bundle, whilst the publication is still able to prove out the model
        through a majority share, being the core creator and contributor.
